I just figured out how to run GPU programs at the CRC server: we need to enter a "gpu stage" first.

Batch job template:

#SBATCH --job-name=gpus-1
#SBATCH --output=gpus-1.out
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --cluster=gpu
#SBATCH --partition=gtx1080
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00

Template command in terminal:

(base) [xid40@login1 ~]$ srun -M gpu -c 2 --partition=titanx --time=1:00:00 --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash



srun: job 241445 queued and waiting for resources

srun: job 241445 has been allocated resources




(base) [xid40@gpu-stage02 ~]$ ls









when I try to run the following code: (base) [xid40@gpu-stage06 PyTorch-VAE]$ python run.py -c configs/vae.yaml

I got the following error, it looks like I did not get GPU allocated, although I am in GPU mode

pytorch_lightning.utilities.exceptions.MisconfigurationException: You requested GPUs: [1]

But your machine only has: [0]

I believe that the error message is self-explanatory. Your configuration file has specified gpus: [1]. When you requested a single GPU card, the gpu index is 0.

trainer_params:
gpus: [0]
